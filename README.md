Hi guys who can see my new small project about play music. I have just cloned a music app from other person who i was studing, and i try my best to make it look like the original. Another one thing, my English is so bad, so i can not say all thing what i want as its have many misstake in grammar, hope everyone understand what i say. 
# MP3-app only HTML, CSS, JS (no framework, no library)
## Music app with some basic features :
- Scroll make the CD be scaled and the CD can rotate while song is playing
- Play/Pause/Next/Pre song
- Random/Repeat/Seek (contact with progress bar)
- The song will never stop unless be stopped by user; user can play any song by a click
- And the song status will be saved in local Storage
